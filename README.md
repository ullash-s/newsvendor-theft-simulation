Stochastic Newsvendor model with theft-adjusted demand simulation and Poisson-based expected profit optimization.
# Newsvendor Model with Theft ‚Äî Simulation + Optimization

This project analyzes how **inventory theft (shrinkage)** affects the optimal order quantity in the classic **Newsvendor Problem**.

We model:
- Customer arrivals as **Poisson(Œª)**
- Theft events as **Poisson(Œª √ó thief%)**
- Inventory consumption = **sales + stolen units**
- Profit = revenue ‚Äì purchasing cost + salvage value on leftovers

The goal is to find the **optimal starting inventory Q\*** that **maximizes expected profit** under different:
- Theft percentages
- Season lengths
- Cost and salvage rates

## üß† Key Idea

Because theft reduces inventory **before** customers arrive, the **observed demand is distorted**.  
If we ignore theft, we **underestimate true demand** and order too little.

This is important in:
- Retail store shrinkage
- Warehouse pilferage
- Supply chain safety stock planning

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run (Beginner-Friendly)

You can run this in **Google Colab** (no installation needed).

1. Open Colab: https://colab.research.google.com
2. Upload the notebook from the `notebooks/` folder
3. Run the cells in order
4. The model will compute:
   - Optimal Q\*
   - Expected profit
   - Demand / theft statistics
